## Automatic repo creation and deployment

During the onboarding, Mintlify created a repo at my Github and automatically deployed the site. I mean... that's kinda... cool?

## Clone repo

So, repo created. How do I add contents to the site and preview locally?

First, I like this new style with MDX. As someone coming from Hugo. It feels like a breath of fresh air to finally be able to use shortcodes (components) in pure html without VScode shouting at me with them squiggly eyes.
